## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I don't think I learned anything new. Among the techniques used, I already had theoretical knowledge, but the project was interesting to practice my coding skills.

### Continued development

I'm still a little uncomfortable with flexbox, but I believe that with the next projects this should improve.

I'm not sure why an image is overflowing inside a certain container. I tough that would fit to the parent container. The solution I found was to force the image's width or height to 100% (width). Don't know if this is enough or if it's necessary to add the object-fit property. Maybe I need to do more research.
